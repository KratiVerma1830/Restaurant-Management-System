# Restaurant-Management-System
# PROBLEM STATEMENT
Implement several C++ classes for the management system of a restaurant. Records of orders will be stored using arrays.
Implement a command line interface for the restaurant management system which provides the following menu:
1. Create an order
2. Search a food by ID
3. List all foods ordered in the restaurant
4. Show total cost orders for the restaurants
5. List all food in a given order
6. List all food of a given order grouped as appetisers, main dishes, and desserts with total cost of each group.
7. Show total cost of a given order
8. Exit
Use data structures together with classes developed in order to store collections of objects.
In order to implement this system it needs to implement classes with the attributes, constructors, destructors, copy constructors and other member functions.
